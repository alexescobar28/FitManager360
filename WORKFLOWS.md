# FitManager360 - Microservices Architecture

This file is to trigger GitHub Actions workflows.

## Active Workflows:

- ✅ API Gateway deployment
- ✅ Auth Service deployment
- ✅ Routine Service deployment
- ✅ Chat Service deployment
- ✅ Stats Service deployment
- ✅ Frontend deployment

## Testing Strategy:

### Backend Services Tests:

- **Health Checks**: Verify each service responds correctly
- **Authentication**: Test auth middleware and JWT validation
- **API Endpoints**: Validate request/response formats
- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error responses

### Test Coverage:

- Auth Service: 6 tests (health, metrics, validation, auth flows)
- Routine Service: 6 tests (health, metrics, auth protection)
- Chat Service: 6 tests (health, metrics, room management)
- Stats Service: 6 tests (health, metrics, body metrics)
- API Gateway: 6 tests (health, proxy routing, CORS)
- Frontend: Basic component rendering tests

### CI/CD Pipeline:

1. **Change Detection**: Only test changed services
2. **Unit Tests**: Run Jest tests for each service
3. **Health Checks**: Verify all endpoints respond
4. **Deploy**: Only deploy services that pass tests
5. **Integration**: Verify service communication post-deploy
